# C# (C Sharp)

The program I enrolled in was primarily C#.

The entries here come from all the different C# programming courses.

A few of them require SQL Server to run; one course covered C# ADO.Net and another covered Enterprise programming (ADO.Net,
LINQ, and Entity Framework).

You will find solution and project files for these projects, even when there is a single source file.
