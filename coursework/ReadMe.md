# Coursework

I attended (Bellevue college)[www.bellevuecollege.edu] from September 2015 to June 2017 for an associates, AAS-T, in
[information systems, software developer track](https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/programs/degrees/proftech/is/#is-aast).

I earned a 3.91 GPA.

This part of my portfolio includes assignments from the various programming classes I took.

Currently, you will find C# and C++ examples.

SQL will follow in the near future.

An example of HTML 5, CSS 3 and JavaScript, from the
[Introduction to Web Development](https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/classes/All/PROG/109),
can be found [here](http://jonkillian.atwebpages.com/final/index.html). It is the final project for the class and
represents a portfolio. The [Artifacts](http://jonkillian.atwebpages.com/final/exhibition.html) page shows multiple
assignments from the class and [Creativity](http://jonkillian.atwebpages.com/final/lightbulb.html) page shows off new
stuff (per instructions). For the latter, I chose to add a video, using HTML5 playback, and embed a google maps. You may notice the date/time at the bottom, it randomly changes its format periodically (set on a random time)
