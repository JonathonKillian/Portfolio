# My Portfolio

I am Jon Killian and you have reached my source code portfolio.

The course work, or college, side is filled with multiple examples; I am still working on knocking the dust off of my more
personal/non-school programs.

I can code in C++, C#, HTML/CSS, Javascript, SQL (queries, stored procedures and functions) and command/DOS batch script.

I have dabbled in Python, Perl 5.x, and Linux Bash scripting, and I have samplied multiple other languages.

I first learned to program in BASIC on an Apple ][+ back in 1981, 5th grade.

I have previously been taught machine language, assembly, C, and COBOL (back in 1988-1989).

During my employment over the years, I have coded programs to aid in my duties, or just to learn.

It is the latter case that had me create a log parser in Perl 5.x and Bash script to partition, format, and mount multiple
drives (expanding on a "one-liner" lab procedure).

From 2008 to 2014, I worked multiple contracts on the Microsoft main campus as a software test engineer. Before that, I
worked from 2002 to 2007 as both a contractor and then full-hire at Intel at their DuPont location (now closed).

The software testing I did involved executing test plans and test cases written by others. After my last lay-off, I failed
to find another testing position and decided to update my programming skills to get a software developer role.

Thank you for taking time to peruse my portfolio. You are also welcome to my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/JonathonKillian)
